# project-3

### Overview
In 2022, it was found that around 63% of Americans regularly engage in drinking alcohol, be it socially or otherwise. In our project, we wanted to dig deeper into:
- How much alcohol Americans consumed in 2022.
- The adverse effects of alcohol, and how many people have died due to alcohol-related causes.
- What medical facilities are in place to assist with alcohol addiction.

3) Are there sufficient rehabilitation resources in areas where alcohol-related deaths are prevalent, i.e. California?
4) Is there a relationship between the amount of alcohol consumption per capita and the amount of available resources for alcoholism?
5) Which demographics are most affected by alcohol-related diseases?
6) What are the age, gender, and ethnicity groups associated with the alcohol dataset in California?
