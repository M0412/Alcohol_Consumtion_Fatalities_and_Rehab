# project-3

### Overview
Analyzing the alcohol consumption to death ratio per state to find any observable geo-trends, and comparing it against available resources for rehabilitation. Through this project, we focus specifically on California and answer questions related to alcohol-related deaths, by gender, age, and chronic diseases  - simultaneously drawing relationships between rehabs/AAs etc.

Is there a relationship between the amount of alcohol consumption per capita and the amount of available resources for alcoholism?
Which demographics are most affected by alcohol-related diseases?
What are the age, gender, and ethnicity groups associated with the alcohol dataset in California?
